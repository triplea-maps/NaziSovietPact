<h1>Nazi Soviet Pact </h1> <br> <br>     <b> Created by: Black Elk, Madmat, Beagle and Cousin Joe </b> <br>      Pact of Steel is an original TripleA module developed as a variant of the 4th edition Axis and Allies rule-set. <br>      Our initial goal was to incorporate Italy as the 6th major power in the game, and along the way to correct some <br>     of the imbalances we saw in standard 4th edition. The module represents a hypothetical WW2 scenario, which tries <br>     to reproduce what the war might have been like in 1942 had Mussolini been more successful in his early Mediterranean <br>     campaigns. The game functions under a 15 VC set up with Major Victory at 11 VCs captured (the new VCs are Stalingrad, <br>     Sydney and Honolulu.) I think the module is an excellent example of what users can accomplish with tripleA's custom <br>     editing tools. A few months ago Pact of Steel was just an interesting 'what-if' scenario, but thanks to the efforts <br>     of the tripleA community we now have an actual game to play. I hope everyone enjoys it. <br> <br> <i>     Thanks again thanks to all the Devs and playtesters who helped get this project together: <br>      DMA02 (Nekro), Iron Cross, Aibrahim, SGB, KC1189, Zero Pilot, Tactics, Underdog and the whole crew. <br>       You guys all rock! <br> <br>      -Triplelk
